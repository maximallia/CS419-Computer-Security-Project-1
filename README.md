Problem 1: Understanding Attacks

(Easy) We have learned how to perform a white-box attack against Deep Neural Networks. In this task, you are required to try to compare different attacks and their effects. We will be working on the ImageNet dataset.

Problem 2: Attack that Transfers

(Challenging) Traditional attacks aim to attack a single model. As we know, adversarial examples do transfer, which is the foundation of many black box attacks. How about white box attacks then?

Problem 3: Black-box Attack (Bonus)

(Hard) Google Could Vision API provides ML services for image classification. It is a black box model and limit free users to try less than 1000 units/month. Can you attack it?

Problem 4: Understanding backdoors

(Easy) DNNs are easily poisoned. Let us try to create our own triggers.

Problem 5: Generating Fake Videos

(Easy) Use existing DeepFake models to create fake videos.
